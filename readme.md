# Day 2 of 100 days of coding (OOP) 

Learning with a video created by Code with Josh 4 Pillars of OOP <br>
Also building a better readme and using markdown

4 pillars of OOP

-Encapsulation   (wrapping up your data, controlling access to them)  <br>
-Inheritance     (inherting data from another class)  <br>
-Polymorphism    (An object can have many form "think cloning")  <br>
-Abstraction     (SHowing only the essential features)  <br>

**********************************
* Property = Variable in a class *
* Method = Function in a class   *
