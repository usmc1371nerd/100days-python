# Day 1 of 100 days of coding (python)

Built a Python Bank from a tutorial Code Nust


# Day 2 of 100 days of coding (OOP)

Learning with a video created by Code with Josh 4 Pillars of OOP <br>
Also building a better readme and using markdown

4 pillars of OOP

-Encapsulation   (wrapping up your data, controlling access to them)  <br>
-Inheritance     (inherting data from another class)  <br>
-Polymorphism    (An object can have many form "think cloning")  <br>
-Abstraction     (SHowing only the essential features)  <br>

**********************************
* Property = Variable in a class *
* Method = Function in a class   *
**********************************

* Only had time to work into Encapsulation and Inhertiance *

# Day 3 of 100 days of coding (OOP)

Finsihed reviewing some of the 4 pillars of OOP

# Day 4 of 100 days of coding (python)
reviewed my code for a side project Im doing @ this repos https://github.com/usmc1371nerd/python-banking

# Day 5 of 100 days of coding (python)
I corrected and pushed code to git for side project mention above

# Day 6 of 100 days of code (python)
on my project https://github.com/usmc1371nerd/python-banking I created the database
leanred alot about different ways to connect my db vs how the applications run. Made many mistakes such as
Class user: not capitlized and I deleted (db.model) in my models.py spent painfully 2 hours of messing around to figure it out. I will now move forward with creating the front end of the app. Trying to create the backend first and then the frontend.
