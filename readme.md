# Day 2 of 100 days of coding (OOP) 

Learning with a video created by Code with Josh 4 Pillars of OOP

4 pillars of OOP

-Encapsulation   (wrapping up your data, controlling access to them)  \n
-Inheritance     (inherting data from another class)  \n
-Polymorphism    (An object can have many form "think cloning")  \n
-Abstraction     (SHowing only the essential features)  \n
